# Data_Analysis
This repository contains various case studies on data analysis which use python, and various python libraries for data wrangling, visualization 

Case Study 1: Cyclistic Data Analysis

This case study explores the data of cyclistic bike users: casual riders and members of cyclistic. People who opt for one-use pass or full-day pass are considered as casual riders whereas people who have annual membership are considered as members. The aim of this case study to identify how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently and how the casual riders can be converted to annual members, thereby gaining more profits since annual membership brings more profit than the casual riders.
>>This case study uses the available dataset on kaggle: /kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023
>>It uses python libraries: pandas, seaborn and matplotlib

Case Study 2: BellaBeat Case Study

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women is a successful small company, and wants to focus on new opportunities and grow their market further by analyzing smart devices' fitness data. Throughout this case study, I will focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the company's growth. 
>>This case study uses the available dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit
>>Tools used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

Project 3: Gender Prediction using Sound
Focus on Children’s Picture Books from the weekly list of best-selling books from different genres published by The New York Times, 
and analyze the gender distribution of authors to see if there have been changes over time from 2008 to 2017. (reference to Datacamp project)
This basic project uses the concept of Fuzzy and uses fuzzy.nysiis package to get similar name sounds and extracts the gender of a person using that. 
Modules used: Pandas, Numpy, Fuzzy, Matplotlib

Project 4: Predicting Sleep Disorder
This project focuses on generating a prediction model that could detect if a person has or could have sleep disorder in near future based on parameters like age, Gender, BMI< Physical Activity, Occupation and more. This could be helpful to see if based on their habits, a person has a potential future risk of sleep disorder. It involves data preparing, data visualization, model training, feature engineering, model evaluation and model validation.
  Dataset used in this: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset
  Used Libraries: Python - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.plotly ML - Logistic Regression, Descison Tree, SVC, KNN, Random Forest. 

  Project 5: Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data
  Cleaning datasets and splitting dataset to divide the data and create .csv files with the appropriate data. Dealt with datetime, pandas, numpy libraries to accomplish the task.

  Project 6: Exploring London Transport using Snowflake SQL
  Explored the dataset related to london travel network present in the Snowflake and used SnowflakeSQL to understand the data and answer key questions.
  Related Files -> tfl_journeys (CSV file containing the london transport details) and notebook featuring the tasks performed.
  Dataset --> https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset
  Database: Snowflake, SQL
  
Project 7: Netflix Data Analysis - Exploring insights in data
This project focuses on the EDA of the Netflix Data released in the year 2020-21. Few questions that are answered in the analysis are:
(1) Which country produces most content? (2) Why the netflix video count soared? (3) Top movies as per country (4) Top Series as per country (5) Show rating effected by month of release (6) Movie/Show rating affected by genre/rating

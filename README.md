Data Analysis Projects
Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! This collection contains various case studies that demonstrate my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization using Python and its libraries. Feel free to explore the individual projects below, each accompanied by a brief description of the objectives, methods, and tools used.

Projects
1. Cyclistic Data Analysis 🚴‍♀️
Objective:
This case study explores the usage patterns of Cyclistic bike users, comparing casual riders and annual members. The goal is to identify how casual riders use bikes differently and discover strategies to convert them into annual members.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Dataset:
Kaggle Cyclistic Dataset

2. BellaBeat Case Study 🏃‍♀️
Objective:
Analyzing fitness data from Bellabeat, a health-tech company focused on women’s wellness. The analysis aims to provide insights on how consumers use their smart devices, guiding marketing strategies for product growth.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Dataset:
Kaggle Fitbit Dataset

3. Gender Prediction using Sound 🎧
Objective:
Analyze the gender distribution of authors from the weekly list of best-selling children’s picture books (NY Times). The project uses sound-based gender prediction with the Fuzzy package to identify gender from similar-sounding names.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Fuzzy
Matplotlib
4. Predicting Sleep Disorder 😴
Objective:
This project develops a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a sleep disorder based on factors like age, gender, BMI, physical activity, and occupation. The model uses different ML algorithms for prediction.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVC, KNN, Random Forest
Dataset:
Kaggle Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset

5. Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data 💼
Objective:
Clean and preprocess a dataset related to a bank’s marketing campaign. This project focuses on handling missing values, dealing with datetime fields, and splitting the data into smaller subsets.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
6. Exploring London Transport with Snowflake SQL 🚇
Objective:
Analyze London transport data using Snowflake SQL, answering key questions about journey patterns and trends.

Dataset:
London Travel Dataset

Database: Snowflake, SQL

7. Netflix Data Analysis - Exploring Insights 🎬
Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights such as top countries for content production, the relationship between release month and show ratings, and more.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
8. Birth Rate Analysis 👶
Objective:
Analyze trends in birth rates over the years in the United States using publicly available data from the CDC.

Dataset:
Births Dataset

9. Screen Time Analysis using Python 📱
Objective:
This project analyzes a user’s screen time, detailing which applications and websites are used most frequently and the relationship between screen time and usage patterns.

10. The Power of Handwashing: Analyzing Maternal Mortality 🧼
Objective:
Reanalyze historical data to evaluate the impact of handwashing on maternal mortality rates at the Vienna General Hospital in the 1800s. This project demonstrates how pandas, bootstrap methods, and visualization tools can be used to explore historical health data.

Key Libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Bootstrap Methods
